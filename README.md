# royRepository
My website “Roy Longbottom's PC Benchmark Collection” at http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/ might not be around much longer due to my age of 88 in 2023. The reports and code are available from PDF files at ResearchGate and most from HTM files via roylongbottom.org.uk at Wayback Machine. Some have also been  deposited by others  here in GitHub. Initially, my main intention  is to make them accessible from my royRepository.
